      <h2>Reservation, cancellation and payment Terms and Conditions</h2>
      <p>
        {`The following terms and conditions apply to individual stays in holiday cabin accommodation and on caravan, motorhome and camping sites at Brisbane Gateway Resort. For group reservations of 3 or more cabins, separate group reservation terms and conditions will apply which can be viewed on our website “groups” section.`}
      </p>
      <h3>{`Rates`}</h3>
      <p>
        {`The rate for a particular reservation is only guaranteed not to change once the reservation has been confirmed by us.

All rates quoted are in Australian Dollars ($AUD) and are inclusive of the Goods & Services Tax (GST).

Quoted rates may fluctuate according to expected peak periods. Peak periods generally correspond with school holidays, public holidays and weekends (Fri & Sat nights) but may include other periods.

Quoted rates may fluctuate according to occupancy levels in a particular category of accommodation.

Minimum stay periods may apply for particular categories of accommodation or for certain rates and special offers.

All rates are non-commissionable unless specified.`}
      </p>
      <h3>Deposits for reservations</h3>
      <p>
        {`The payment of a deposit is required before a reservation is confirmed.

The amount of the deposit depends on the type of accommodation being booked; the rate type; whether the reservation is during a peak period; and the length of stay. Unless otherwise stated, the deposit will be the first night's tariff or 25 percent of the total stay, whichever is greater.

Some special offer rates, discounted rates and peak periods may require the total stay to be paid upfront as the deposit amount.

For reservations involving caravan, motorhome and camping sites, a "pre-authorisation" or "credit card hold" may be accepted in lieu of the payment of the deposit. In such cases, if a cancellation occurs in default of the cancellation terms, the credit card will be charged with the original deposit amount.

In all cases, you will be advised of the deposit amount and how it must be paid when you make the reservation.

If you are concerned about incurring losses in relation to a cancellation and/or change to a booking, we strongly recommend that you give consideration to insuring against such an event with a reputable travel insurer.`}
